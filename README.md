This is a simple website generator I built when I was younger, it kind of works.

The SRC directory holds CSS/JS/Templates that are used with the page definitions in SRC/Data to generate a static website. The SRC/Data folder is used to fill the templates creating a web page per file. The CSS/JS/Templates are linked to by every page.

Additionally, the static site will have an auto-generated directory, automatically record page creation times, and link related/new pages.

This is done by calling the top level python script.
