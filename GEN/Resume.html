<p>This was the first time I felt like I had enough content to justify two pages. I had been trying to fit on one page by any means necessary, including .1 inch margins and less than 8pt font. You can see an older resume <a href="/resume_2_20.html">HERE</a>.</p>

	<h4><a href="/ugcpu.html">My Custom 8-Bit CPU</a></h4>
