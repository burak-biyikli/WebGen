<p>Howdy, howdy! My name is Burak Biyikli. I am a UT Alumni who still hopes to get a PhD one day. At UT I found that I had a broad set of interests, including teaching embedded systems, interning in the IC design space, learning 3D modeling and welding, and doing research in computer architecture. I have found a passion for learning about the systems that power our world from every level I can see. Similarly, my coursework and degrees cover a range of topics from Math and IC Design to Computer architecture and Embedded Systems.</p>

<p>I started teaching and mentoring back in high school, where I was leading Mathcounts sessions for younger students. It was incredibly rewarding to see them progress, and that experience carried over to my time at UT. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I've had the privilege of mentoring over 330 students in embedded systems design, guiding them through complex topics like firmware development and SoC architecture. Seeing them succeed with their own ambitious projects—like building a Gameboy emulator or a haptic feedback mouse—has been a highlight of my academic career.</p>

<p>There's a sense of satisfaction in taking a project from just an idea into a moment where you have a reason to learn something new. I've had the opportunity to design and build everything from a custom 8-bit CPU at the transistor level to a 3D graphics engine optimized to run on a low-power microcontroller. These projects helped me better contextualize the work I did at Texas Instruments, AMD, and the FAST research group; letting me explore how modern computing works beyond what can fit in a class or what needs to be done for tomorrow.</p>

<p>Whether you're a former student, a new colleague, or just a fellow enthusiast, I'm glad you're here. Please feel free to explore my resume, browse through the website, and see what I've been working on. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
