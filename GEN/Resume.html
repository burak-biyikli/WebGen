<p>This was the first time I felt like I had enough content to justify two pages. I had been trying to fit on one page by any means necessary, including .1 inch margins and less than 8pt font. You can see an older resume <a href="/resume_2_20.html">HERE</a>.</p>

	<p>A colleague sent me a link. Hours later, I was still deep in a rabbit hole of assembly, auto-vectorization, and benchmarking GCC vs. Clang. One of my long time colleagues Brendan sent me a link that you can view HERE. Naturally, I opened it as soon as ...</p>
