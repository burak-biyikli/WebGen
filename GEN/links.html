	<h4><a href="/2025compilertest.html">Micro-Benchmarking Compiler Auto-Vectorization</a></h4>
	<p>A colleague sent me a link. Hours later, I was still deep in a rabbit hole of assembly, auto-vectorization, and benchmarking GCC vs. Clang. One of my long time colleagues Brendan sent me a link that you can view HERE. Naturally, I opened it as soon as ...</p>
