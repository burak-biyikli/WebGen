There are far better ways to have made the website you are on today than what I have done. And that is not to put down github pages, but instead to say that the custom static website generator used to make this page is mainly kept for sentimental reasons.

For better and for worse I have been online since a young age. Although I don't know if this would have been good for everyone, I think I have good friends, memories, and learnings from my time online. One part of this was being curious with what it would take to put something of my own online.

I remember setting up my first google site. It was a simple site both personally and for school. Looking at the timeline this must of been between 2008 and 2017. My vauge recollection is creating websites both for school work and on my personal time during middle school.

I remember wanting to get a custom domain for my site, and trying to learn what DNS entailed. At the end I was lamenting the fact that I did not have the money to buy a domain to actually make this work.

Around highschool there started to be more of an opurtunity to really do more. I helped some friends and family make websites with applications like squarespace and wordpress. I also took a course that taught IT basics that was meant to prep you for a comptia certification. In that course I wrote multiple pages of straight HTML as part of excersises to learn formating, which was a big step up from only really using the links and markdown from my old site.

I looked into how the wordpress site was running, because it looked like software that I could download. Looking into cloud hosting once again thwarted me from being able to setup something for my own. I ended up finding some articles talking about XAMPP which was my first real 'success' getting something of 'my own' working.

I remember feeling like port forwarding and finding my own IP address was a big challenege. But seeing my own site on another device, and then having someone else able to see it at their home was very gratifying.

My website was very janky, and did not really have anything worth seeing on it. As I made more pages, I ended up spending more time churning and started to see more of the value offered in template systems.

To be clear, at this time I did not have good programing skills. This places it before my first year of highschool. I had read some Java and Lua tutorials. I think the most 'impressive' program I made was one to find prime numbers in Lua. Unforutnately I did not really know how to use a for loop in lua, so the code was comically bad. I read good things about python, and I wanted to learn it.

I remember reading good things about Django which seems like it would solve my problems and not really 'getting it'. Prehaphs it was my lack of knowelege of datastructures and interfaces making it hard to even understand what was going on with libraries.

A similar story happened with me and Flask when that looked like a new thing. I was able to copy the work done in tutorials but couldn't really make something of my own.

This was how I first ended up making my own libary to automate making the static websites I used to try to make when I was younger.

Over the years I would come back and edit my old code in fits and starts. The biggest change was late in my undergrad when I got 100 dollars of free azure credit, and bought a domain to get my website online. After that I setup a free CDN so that I could get HTTPS working on the website. I was worried about the mechanics of it and never put much content up in the end because I didn't feel I had anything worth sharing, and maybe I still don't. 

After changes to automatic certificate generation, and CDN changes from akami for Azure, I decided to move the website to github pages. It was kind of remarkable how easy it was to setup hosting and get a certificate compared to 4 years ago. I wonder how much it was the proceess changing versus how much I changed.
